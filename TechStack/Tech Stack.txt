Tech Stack:
----------
			->Framework is designed for functional testing where test data will not be changing freequently.
Selenium 		->Open source tool which is used testing for web based application.
Java 			->Programming and scripting language.
Maven			->Project Build management tool.
TestNg		->TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language inspired by JUnit and NUnit.
Extent Report	->Html reporting.
Apache POI		->for excel operation.
POM			->Implementing page object model for maintaining and upgrading page classes indepeldently.

Package Defined:
	1.Constants  ->File path and user directory
	2.Framework  ->Base class and operational Reusable functions
	3.InitilizeRunconfiguration ->Excel  data operations and object repositroy
	4.Listeners  ->TestNg listner and webdriver reusable functions
	5.POM		 ->Page based classes and reusable functions
	6.TestCases	 ->Test class

Resources Used:
	1.Excel file
	2.Drivers
	3.properties

Flexibility:
	1.We can access data from 
		i.		Database
		ii.		Excel
		iii.	Config.properties
		iv.		Json
	2.Compatible with firefox ,edge, chrome,IE,headless drivers
	3.proper window handles
	4.Runtime testcase control
		->we are contoling the execution of test case from xml files while providing test case Id as primary key
		->Primary key will be treated as group id
